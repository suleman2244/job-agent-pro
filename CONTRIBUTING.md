# Contributing to JobAgent Pro

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/suleman2244/job-agent-pro/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/suleman2244/job-agent-pro/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Python: follow PEP 8
* React: follow Airbnb Style Guide
